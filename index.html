              My journey began in the world of graphic design, where I earned an
              associate’s degree and honed my eye for aesthetics. Driven to
              expand my skillset, I pursued a bachelor’s degree in web design,
              blending my creative roots with the technical tools to build
              engaging websites.

              For the past 11 years, I’ve been a key part of the team at UNO,
              focusing on front-end development in a CMS with HTML, CSS, and
              Velocity. I’ve recently embraced the dynamic power of JavaScript,
              diving into it over the past couple of years to enhance
              interactivity and functionality in my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive on solving problems, learning new technologies, and
              bridging the gap between design and development.

              Cassia is an extremely talented web developer. She has
              demonstrated the ability over the last year to jump into foreign
              code bases such as the RFI and auth page and quickly develop
              meaningful improvements.

              Cassia has maintained and/or exceeded output in a remote working
              environment. She has found a method of working remotely that is
              highly productive.

              Cassia has exhibited her exceptional skill in managing multiple
              competing initiatives while still meeting our stakeholders'
              expectations for timely delivery.

              Ms. Nebel is also a very skilled written communicator and her
              responses to stakeholders via electronic systems are thoroughly
              explained and well written.
            </p>

              The level of care and quality Cassia gives to deliverables is
              exemplary. I find it remarkable that we do not get that many
              reports of broken functionality on obscure or outdated browsers,
              and this stands as a testament to the quality of code Ms. Nebel
              produces. Cassia has also taken it upon herself to help users who
              may have assistive technology needs through adapting code to WCAG
              2.0 guidelines.

              Design and user experience are often the base metric used to judge
              software quality, and having her on the ITS team is critical to
              continually displaying value to our stakeholder community. She has
              developed a reputation for delivering software of the highest
              quality.
